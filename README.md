# Archmocha

Archmocha is a ZSH theme with some of the catppuccin mocha theming but with an Arch Linux twist.

## Installation

To install I recommend for now to copy the contents of the .zsh-theme file, and creating a theme named `archmocha.zsh-theme` in your zsh themes folder.

You can find this folder in `~./.oh-my-zsh/themes` usually.

Once added to your themes folder, update your .zshrc to change the theme to archmocha.

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="archmocha"
```

Note: An actual installation script/symlink of some kind will be added in the future for upstream updates :)
